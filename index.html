                    Ferro is a Devil-Blood, a distant descendant of the Demons,
                    and possesses several traits of their bloodline. Her physical
                    capabilities exceed normal human limits, including speed,
                    endurance, tolerance to pain, healing, ability to go without 
                    sleep, and hearing. Her vision is especially acute; she can see 
                    in near-total darkness and her distance perception is as good
                    as a man with a spyglass. However, she is completely color-blind.
                    Her demonic heritage also allows Ferro to safely handle The Seed, 
                    and seemingly allowed her to sense its presence in the House of the Maker.

                Collem West is a common-born Major in the Union Army, and a secondary

                worried-looking man with a sharp, lined face and thinning hair.
                Collem West is intelligent and dilligent with a good heart; he tries to 
                do what he can for those less fortunate than himself, like Goodman Heath.
                However, he also has a terrible temper, which he finds hard to control. 
                This is exacerbated by the chronic headaches he periodically suffers from.
